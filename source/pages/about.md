Hi there! My name is <a href="https://epatr.com" target="_blank">Eric</a>, and I'm a huge fan of improv podcasts. I got my first taste of improv with the Upright Citizens Brigade show on CC when I was a kid, and I was fortunate enough to find the UCB Theatre in NYC on my first visit there. I don't like in a major market city and I very rarely get to go out and see performances, so podcasts are keeping me connected with the greatest minds in comedy. 

I was disturbed when Earwolf announced that they would begin removing their old episodes from the open internet and putting them behind a subscription service. It meant that the longevity of something that meant a ton to me was suddenly no longer infinite. I created this website to attempt to document, outside of commercial interest, the beauty of improv podcasts. I hope you enjoy it!
