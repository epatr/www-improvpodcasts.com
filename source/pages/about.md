Hi there! My name is <a href="https://epatr.com" target="_blank">Eric</a>, and I'm a huge fan of improv podcasts. I got my first taste of improv with the Upright Citizens Brigade show on CC when I was a kid, and I was fortunate enough to find the UCB Theatre in NYC on my first visit there, long before Google Maps made it trivial to find literal holes in the wall. My only tattoo is of the birthday cat, with a blank speech bubble above him for you to improv your own meaning. 

I was disturbed when Earwolf announced that they would begin removing their old episodes from the open internet and putting them behind a subscription service. It meant that the longevity of something that meant a lot to me was suddenly no longer permanent. I created this website as an attempt to document, outside of commercial interest, the beauty of improv podcasts. I hope you enjoy it!
