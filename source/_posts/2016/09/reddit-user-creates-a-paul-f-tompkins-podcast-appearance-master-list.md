A Reddit user has created a list of all of Paul F. Tompkins' podcast appearances. The user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jesse4788">/u/jesse4788</a>, has shared the list on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZ4yB1vw5qGb8_OFseqE2lImecoGeDrR4-nmHb-DxJI/">Google Sheets</a>. It appears to be more of a personal project of Jesse's, because he's included a column called "Listened?".

Hopefully he's not trying to listen to every episode. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/54y5cz/pft_has_hit_1000_hours_of_podcasting/">post</a> on the sub-reddit /r/Earwolf, he SUM'd up the runtime column and discovered PFT has contributed to <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseHair/status/781212224136314880">over 1,000 hours of podcasting</a>.
